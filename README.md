# File-Organizer
This is simple terminal-based file organizer which helps to organizes multiple different types of files into Different Folders 
I have Designed this in a way that , i can directly map they File extenstions to theri designated folders,because it is made in python it is slow
but the future plan is to make this completely in C , so that i will be realiable and Fast for larger files
